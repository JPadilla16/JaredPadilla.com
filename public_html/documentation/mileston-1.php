			<p><h3>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h3>

			Purpose: This Project is professional portfolio with a focus on web development.

			Audience: I will be designing the site with a professional audience in mind, targetting
			individuals in the web development, I.T., as well as for individuals who are looking for web
			development.

			Goal: The Primary goal of my site is for users of the site to contact me for web development
			opportunities through connected social media or contact form. Secondary goal of site is to display
			all my work and present a professional online presence.

			<h3>Persona</h3>

			Name:Chance Smith

			Age: 24 years old

			Profession: Founder of CraftBeer.com, a startup that is looking to hire a full/part time Web
			Developer. They just recieved all their shipments from various craft breweries. They sell craft
			beers from all over the United States.

			Technology: Mac User. Uses a 13" Macbook pro laptop and has an iPhone 5c with unlimited 4GLTE.

			Attitudes and Behaviors: Short on time. Always has a full schedule. Although he is always busy
			he likes to do thorough research on who he hires. He's not big on social media but will step out
			of his comfort zone to do a little extra research on potential employees.

			Frustrations and Needs: Chance needs to hire someone who is going to care about the website like
			it was their own company website. He is looking someone with good ethics. He must hire as soon as
			possible so he can't start moving some beer.

			Goals: Chance is concerned with one thing, and that's someone who takes pride in their work.

			Use Case: Chance recieves a cover letter from myself in regards to his Web Dev position for his
			craft beer website. Based on my resume he considers me as one of the canidates to search for via
			Linkedin.

			Being inexperienced he doesn't find much on linkedin but is still interested and wants to know
			more so goes further and checks my personal website for more information.

			Satisfied with my previous work on my personal website he takes the time to squeeze me in his
			busy schedule along with several of his other canidates.
