This is my personal website.
## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This is a great start. Your purpose, audience and goal are sufficiently defined, and your project is set up correctly.
Your HTML code looks pretty good overall, there were just a few minor changes. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- in your .gitignore file, add a "." before "DS_Store"
- character encoding should be "utf-8" not "ufc-8"
- Don't forget the "&gt;" on your opening &lt;html&gt; tag!
- Each separate paragraph should be wrapped in it's own &lt;p&gt; tag. And leave the &lt;h3&gt;s out. This is good for layout, and is semantically correct. See the example below: 
```
<main>

## Milestone 2a Feedback
This is good work. Your site map, content strategy are all clearly outlined, but **your Interation Flow is missing**.

Your wireframes are well done and sufficiently detailed as to provide you with a guide for your front end development phase. Your HTML looks very good.

Because your Interaction Flow in missing, I can only mark this Milestone 2&alpha; at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP. Update this document with an Interaction Flow and I will pass this Milestone at Tier II.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Consider combining your About Me and Contact pages. Unless you are planning to feature enough content to necessitate having two separate pages (unlikely).
- Think a bit about how you would like to feature and present your portfolio content, specifically. Of course this will depend on what kind of content you plan on featuring. This will inform your HTML structure for this section, and if any 3rd party tools might be appropriate.
