This is my personal website.
## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This is a great start. Your purpose, audience and goal are sufficiently defined, and your project is set up correctly.
Your HTML code looks pretty good overall, there were just a few minor changes. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- in your .gitignore file, add a "." before "DS_Store"
- character encoding should be "utf-8" not "ufc-8"
- Don't forget the "&gt;" on your opening &lt;html&gt; tag!
- Each separate paragraph should be wrapped in it's own &lt;p&gt; tag. And leave the &lt;h3&gt;s out. This is good for layout, and is semantically correct. See the example below: 
```
